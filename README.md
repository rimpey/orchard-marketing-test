I based this project on the Parcel JS Bootstrap v4 Boilerplate (https://github.com/Qurus/parcel)
with an npm install to give me a
project structure according to industry best practices using the Sass pre-processor. At every point I was
diligent to check the responsive design creating the most visually pleasing design. I brought the
design to life with a hover zoom on the colour images along with the required click to console.log
and an opacity on hover for the shapes images along with JavaScript that opens a common modal
looping through click events.

I have worked to the list of review criteria building a project with a logical structure and production grade
semantic markup and styling with JavaScript to bring the design to life. I have then placed this code in my
github account as suggested for bonus points.


# Interface Development Test
### Test instructions
Attached you will find two screenshots representing two content blocks in a page. Complete the following:
* Build the two blocks using modern HTML5 standards.
* Build a container area to house the two sections; there are no dimensional requirements for this although we're looking for something similar to bootstrap's `.container` class.
* Use JavaScript to capture all anchor clicks, and `console.log()` the element which has been clicked.
* As with any modern web-build we expect a level of interactivity/animation to be displayed on the nodes.
* All content areas should be deemed as being populated from a CMS - so all copy lengths can vary!

### Technologies
* Any CSS-preprocessors (LESS preferred).
* Any CSS frameworks (Bootsrap preferred).
* If vanilla CSS is used, please include some reasoning for the decision.
* Build tools and task runners are encouraged (i.e. grunt/gulp/webpack).

### Layout
* The layout is expected to work in the latest Chrome/FireFox/Edge versions.
* The layout should be responsive and work on a `320px` mobile device.
* Bearing in mind that this application is expected to be responsive, the developer should consider the appropriate `<meta>` tags.
* *shapes.png:* Each image in this section should display in a modal on click.
* *colours.png:* These items should be links to new pages.

### Review Criteria
We are looking for your ability to give life to static designs. During that process consider:
* *Project structure:* Clean project and logical traversal.
* *JavaScript:* Efficiency of code and efficacy in bringing the design to life.
* *Interface:* Semantic markup and styling.
* *Git:* Bonus points for submission on a github account.
* *Quality:* Production-grade.
